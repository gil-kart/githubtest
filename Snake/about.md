# Snake

So this is my starting screen for my snake app.

As you can see, when you press the S T A R T   G A M E button, the snake starts to move.

The snake moves acorrding to the swiping motion on the screen. as you pick more "apples" the snake growes.

When the snake hits itself, the game stops and a massage appears showing the users his score.

If the user wants to play another game, it's possible doing so by pressing the "play again" button.

and that's about it.
